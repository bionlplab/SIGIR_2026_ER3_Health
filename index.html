  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="overview">
    <p>Healthcare has become a demanding real-world setting for information retrieval (IR) systems, requiring the ability to search, combine, and reason over a rapidly growing and diverse body of technical literature. IR methods now support tasks such as large-scale document search, evidence synthesis, and decision support, but recent advances in deep learning and large language models still struggle with producing outputs that are fully correct, consistent, and grounded in source documents. These limitations highlight that faithfulness to source evidence, transparent system behavior, and traceability of generated content are fundamental IR challenges, not domain-specific concerns. </p>

    <p>This workshop focuses on evidence-grounded retrieval, reasoning, and generation in healthcare. It brings together researchers to study retrieval-augmented generation, hierarchical and memory-based retrieval, multimodal retrieval, and human-centered evaluation techniques that explicitly address uncertainty, bias, and provenance.</p>

    <p> Aligned with core SIGIR themes such as ethical IR, evaluation, digital libraries, and societal impact, the workshop aims to advance reliable and trustworthy IR systems with lessons that generalize beyond healthcare to other high-risk domains.</p>

  <h2>Call for Papers & Participation</h2>
  <div class="overview">
    <p>Healthcare decisions increasingly rely on finding, combining, and presenting information from a vast and fast-growing body of medical research. Information retrieval (IR) systems are now deeply embedded in this process, supporting everyday tasks such as searching the medical literature, developing clinical guidelines, conducting systematic reviews, and providing information to patients and caregivers. While recent advances in deep learning and large language models have improved healthcare decisions, these models can still generate incorrect, inconsistent, or fabricated information—problems that are especially serious in high-stakes healthcare settings. These failures show that faithfulness to evidence, clear explanations of system behavior, and reliably tracing generated content back to trusted sources remain central challenges in information retrieval, and are therefore of broad interest to the IR community. This workshop complements the main SIGIR 2026 program by focusing on retrieval, reasoning, and generation methods designed for evidence-intensive healthcare scenarios. It aligns closely with SIGIR themes such as the social and societal impact of IR, human-centered search, ethical IR, digital libraries, and evaluation. By using healthcare as a demanding, high-stakes, and high-impact application domain, the workshop will highlight why building evidence-grounded, transparent, and reliable IR systems is both a technical challenge and a societal responsibility, making it a natural and timely fit for the SIGIR community.</p>

    <p><b>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evidence-grounded retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation for healthcare</li>
      <li>Reasoning over retrieved clinical and biomedical evidence</li>
      <li>Multimodal retrieval and decision support using text, images, and structured health data</li>
      <li>Evaluation of factuality, faithfulness, and transparency in LLM-based healthcare systems</li>
      <li>Human-centered and clinician-in-the-loop evaluation for healthcare IR</li>
      <li>Ethical, fair, and responsible deployment of IR and LLM systems in healthcare</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Submission Format</h4>
    <div class="overview">
    <p>Authors may submit full papers (8-15 pages, excluding references) in the ACM SIGIR format used for the SIGIR 2026 Full Paper Track. Submissions must describe work that is not previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not currently under review elsewhere. All submissions must be in English. The workshop follows a single-blind review process. Submissions will be handled electronically through OpenReview.</p>
    <p>All submissions will undergo a peer review by at least two domain experts from the program committee. The selection of papers will be primarily based on the potential to generate discussion and impact future research directions.</p>
    <p>Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop. Selected papers will be invited to publish an extended version of their work in a special issue of the <i><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-biomedical-informatics">Journal of Biomedical Informatics</a></i>.</p>
